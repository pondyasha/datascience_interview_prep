# Data Science Interview Prep
We discuss every possible question we might encounter in data science interview. Theory questions are discussed in readme file and the problems are in .ipynb file. Bonus: you can expect ELI5 kind of answers 

## What is gradient descent and why is it useful in Machine Learning

1. Gradient descent is an optimization technique in most of the machine learning algorithms which helps to minimize the cost function (error between the predicted value and actual value)
2. There are two types of Gradient descent algorithms:
   a. Batch Gradient descent - computationally expensive on large datasets
   b. Stochastic gradient descent - this is scalable and felxible on large datasets
3. Gradient descent is used to optimize the coefficients in machine learning models to make accurate predictions

### Explain gradient descent like I am 5

Say you want to increase the speed of your toy car and you magically happen to find a helper who helps you to try different things like changing the wheels, upgrading the remote etc. Gradient descent is like a magic helper who lets you try different things to improve your machine by giving better equations and numbers. You input these equations in to your machine to get accurate predictions for things like weather it will rain tomorrow or not, weather your teacher eats a chocolate or not :P Eventually, the magic helper will help you find a best way by giving you certain hints like adjusting wheels, weight and gear to increase the speed of your toy car
